What is the main focus of *Competitive Programmer’s Handbook*?	Focuses on competitive programming techniques and problem-solving strategies.
Who wrote the *Competitive Programmer’s Handbook*?	Written by Antti Laaksonen.
When was the draft version published?	Draft published on July 3, 2018.
What is the purpose of flashcards in this document?	They are likely study tools for learning.
"What does ""Contents"" indicate in the document?"	It lists main topics or sections covered.
What is the term for the introductory section before Contents?	"""Preface"" (introduces the document)."
What topic is **6.1 Coin problem** under?	Greedy algorithms
What is **7.2** about?	Longest increasing subsequence (Dynamic programming)
What are the key methods in **8.1**?	Two pointers method (Amortized analysis)
What is the first algorithm in shortest paths?	Bellman–Ford algorithm
What is the topic of section 14?	Tree algorithms
What does section 17 focus on?	Strong connectivity algorithms
What is the definition of a **perpendicular line**?	Two lines intersecting at 90° angles.
What is the **slope** of a vertical line?	Undefined (infinite).
What is the **midpoint** formula?	((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2).
What is the book’s main purpose?	Introduces competitive programming basics; assumes prior programming knowledge but no CP experience.
Who is the book intended for?	Students aiming for IOI/ICPC, general CP enthusiasts, and algorithm learners.
How long does it take to become a good CP programmer?	Continuous practice; emphasizes learning through reading, solving, and contests.
What is competitive programming about?	Combining algorithm design and implementation.
Why is algorithm efficiency important in competitive programming?	Correct and efficient algorithms solve problems optimally.
What skills are needed for algorithm implementation?	Good programming skills and correct implementation for testing.
What is the fastest way to read a whole line with spaces?	Use `getline(cin, s);`.
Why is `endl` slower than `\n`?	`endl` flushes the output buffer; `\n` does not.
What is the purpose of `ios::sync_with_stdio(0)`?	Speeds up `cin`/`cout` by disabling C++/C sync.
